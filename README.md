## How to use application

- To get started, create a new account or log in to an existing one. Once logged in, you can add sneakers to your cart, update your user profile (including your name and avatar image), and proceed to checkout using Stripe. (Note: Stripe is currently in test mode.)

- A test account is already provided on the login page for your convenience — simply log in and start exploring the app.

- This web application is built using JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

- Note: If the website is down due to inactivity, Supabase may shut down the database, causing login errors. If that happens, you can watch a video demonstration of the app’s functionality here:
